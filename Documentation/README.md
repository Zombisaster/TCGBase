# TCGBase

A multi-TCG collection tracking web application designed to help collectors manage and monitor their card collections across different trading card games.  
The project starts with **Pokémon TCG** as the primary implementation and is fully designed to scale into **Magic: The Gathering**, **Yu-Gi-Oh!**, **Lorcana**, and additional TCGs in the future.
