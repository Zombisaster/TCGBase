# TCGBase
<p> A multi-TCG collection tracking web application designed to help collectors manage and monitor their card collections across different trading card games. <br> The project starts with Pokémon TCG as the primary implementation and is fully designed to scale into Magic: The Gathering, Yu-Gi-Oh!, Lorcana, and additional TCGs in the future. </p>
